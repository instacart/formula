/**
 * A deferred action returned by [evaluation][Formula.evaluate] that will run for any new unique
 * value of [key] and will be be cleaned up if [key] changes or if [Action] is
 * left out of evaluation.
 *
 * Action can produce and send [events][Event] back to the [Formula] instance. It
 * can be used to subscribe to RxJava observables, Kotlin Flows, event buses, or any
 * other event mechanism.
 *
 * An [Action] key is a value that defines the identity of the [Action]. If
 * a key changes, the [Action] will be canceled and run again from a fresh state.
 * We also include the code call-site as a key parameter (concept called positional memoization).
 *
 * To construct a RxJava based action (using formula-rxjava3 library), you can do the following:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val action = RxAction.fromObservable { Observable.just(1, 2, 3) }
 * ```
 *
 * To use it within a [Formula]:
 * ```
 * Evaluation(
 *   actions = context.actions {
 *     action.onEvent { event ->
 *       transition()
 *     }
 *   }
 * )
 * ``
 *
 * @param Event A type of event used to notify [Formula].
