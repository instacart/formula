It is inspired by MVU(model, view, update) architecture and best of functional, declarative and reactive patterns. It enables building deterministic, composable, testable applications. Quick example To demonstrate some of the concepts we will make a simple counter application. It shows the current count and has two buttons to increment and decrement it. One of the best practises when working with Formula is to first think what the UI needs for rendering and what actions the user will be able to take. This concept is called a RenderModel and is represented by a Kotlin data class. Render Model Render Model is an immutable representation of your view. It will be used to update Android views. Typically, it will also contain event listeners that will be invoked when user interacts with the UI. data class CounterRenderModel ( val count : String , val onDecrement : Listener < Unit > , val onIncrement : Listener < Unit > , ) Once we define a Render Model, we can create a RenderView which is responsible for taking a RenderModel and applying it to Android Views. Render View Render View is an interface which is responsible for applying RenderModel to Android Views. This interface requires us to provide a render implementation by creating a Renderer . Renderer is a class that has an internal mechanism that checks the previous Render Model applied and only re-renders if it has changed. class CounterRenderView ( root : ViewGroup ): RenderView < CounterRenderModel > { private val decrementButton : Button = root . findViewById ( R . id . decrement_button ) private val incrementButton : Button = root . findViewById ( R . id . increment_button ) private val countTextView : TextView = root . findViewById ( R . id . count_text_view ) override val render : Renderer < CounterRenderModel > = Renderer { model -> countTextView . text = model . count decrementButton . setOnClickListener { model . onDecrement () } incrementButton . setOnClickListener { model . onIncrement () } } } We now defined a single entry-point to our rendering (this makes debugging issues a lot easier). Anytime you need to update UI, just set a new Render Model. renderView . render ( renderModel ) Now that we have our rendering logic setup, let's define how we create the Render Model and handle user events. To have a dynamic UI that changes as user interacts with it requires some sort of state. State State is a Kotlin data class that contains all the necessary information/data to render your view. In our counter example, we need to keep track of the current count. data class CounterState ( val count : Int ) Given that this is a simple state, you could also use Int directly. Formula Formula is responsible for creating the Render Model. It can define an internal State class and respond to various events by transitioning to a new state. class CounterFormula : Formula < Unit , CounterState , CounterRenderModel > { override fun initialState ( input : Unit ): CounterState = CounterState ( count = 0 ) override fun evaluate ( input : Unit , state : CounterState , context : FormulaContext < Int > ): Evaluation < CounterRenderModel > { val count = state . count return Evaluation ( output = CounterRenderModel ( title = \"Count: $ count \" , onDecrement = context . onEvent { transition ( state . copy ( count = count - 1 )) }, onIncrement = context . onEvent { transition ( state . copy ( count = count + 1 )) } ) ) } } The most important part is the Formula.evaluate function. It gives us the current State and expects an Evaluation<RenderModel> back. Any time we transition to a new state, evaluate is called again and new Render Model is created. There is also a special object called FormulaContext being passed. Formula Context allows us to respond to events by declaring transitions. We use context.onEvent for both onIncrement and onDecrement . Let's look at one of these functions closer. onDecrement = context . onEvent { transition ( state . copy ( count = count - 1 )) } In response to the decrement event, we take the current count and subtract 1 from it. Then, we call transition method to create Transition<CounterState> object which we return. If you notice, our logic currently allows user to decrement to a number below 0. We can update the transition logic to prevent this. onDecrement = context . onEvent { if ( count == 0 ) { none () } else { transition ( state . copy ( count = count - 1 )) } } The listener block uses a DSL to provide access to Transition.Factory which has the transition and none utility functions (take a look at that class for other utility functions). Now that we defined our state management, let's connect it to our RenderView . Using Formula Formula is agnostic to other layers of abstraction. It can be used within activity or a fragment. You can convert Formula to an RxJava2 Observable by using start extension function. val formula = CounterFormula () val state : Observable < CounterRenderModel > = formula . toObservable ( input = Unit ) Ideally, it would be placed within a surface that survives configuration changes such as Android Components ViewModel. In this example, we will use Formula Android module. For using Formula with AndroidX ViewModel, take a look at AndroidX Guide . Let's first define our Activity. class MyActivity : FormulaAppCompatActivity () { private lateinit var counterRenderView : CounterRenderView override fun onCreate ( state : Bundle?) { super . onCreate ( state ) setContentView ( R . string . my_screen ) counterRenderView = CounterRenderView ( findViewById ( R . id . counter )) } fun render ( model : CounterRenderModel ) { counterRenderView . render ( model ) } } Now, let's connect CounterFormula to MyActivity.render function. class MyApp : Application () { override fun onCreate () { super . onCreate () FormulaAndroid . init ( this ) { activity < MyActivity > { store ( streams = { val formula = CounterFormula () update ( formula . toObservable (), MyActivity :: render ) } ) } } } } And that's it.

One aspect that might seem quite unusual is the way that it handles asynchronous actions such as RxJava observables, Kotlin Flows, etc. Most developers are used to explicitly managing subscription lifecycle. val fetchUserObservable = repository . fetchUser () disposables += fetchUserObservable . subscribe { userResult -> // Do something } Formula does things a bit differently. It manages the lifecycle of the asynchronous actions for you. Instead of manually subscribing and unsubscribing, you define the conditions for which the asynchronous action should run and the listener which handles events produced by the action. val fetchUserStream = RxStream . fromObservable { repository . fetchUser () } fetchUserStream . onEvent { userResult -> // Do something } The logic looks very similar to the first option, but the key difference here is that Observable.subscribe hasn't run yet - the execution is deferred. It might not be clear why this is useful just from this example, but deferring execution allows us to provide a declarative API. For example, we can add conditional logic to only fetch user when user id is set. if ( state . userId != null ) { val fetchUserStream = RxStream . fromObservable { repository . fetchUser ( state . userId ) } fetchUserStream . onEvent { userResult -> // Do something with the result } } What if we want to fetch user information only after user clicks on some button to enable this. We can just expand on the conditional logic. if ( state . isUserFetchEnabled && state . userId != null ) { // Logic here is the same as the previous example } Here, we don\u2019t care what controls isUserFetchEnabled boolean. Formula will start execution when these conditions are met and will dispose of the action if state.isUserFetchedEnabled becomes false again. What if for some unusual reason the userId could change and we would want to refetch? We can define this behavior using key parameter if ( state . isUserFetchEnabled && state . userId != null ) { val fetchUserStream = RxStream . fromObservable ( key = state . userId ) { repository . fetchUser ( state . userId ) } fetchUserStream . onEvent { userResult -> // Do something with the result } } To understand how all this works, we will make some simplified assumptions about Formula APIs: Each Formula will define an immutable State data class. We use State object in the evaluate(state: State) function which defines the Pair<UIModel, Actions> Any time there is a State change, the Formula runtime will call evaluate again. In code, this might look like this val actionCache : MutableMap < Key , RunningAction > = mutableMapOf () fun onStateChanged ( state : State ) { val ( uiModel , actions ) = formula . evaluate ( state ) // Stop actions actionCache . forEach { ( key , runningAction ) -> if ( ! actions . contains ( key )) { actionCache . remove ( key ) runningAction . stop () } } // Start actions actions . forEach { action -> if ( ! actionCache . contains ( key )) { actionCache [ key ] = action . start () } } } It's worth mentioning that this is an approximate and not the actual implementation. Within our assumptions we didn't discuss formula inputs (passed to configure Formula) and child formulas (enables re-use and composition) which also have an affect on evaluation. Similarly, to how we used State to control the lifecycle of the action, we can use formula input or child formula outputs. To expand on the previous assumptions, let's define how Input interacts with Formula . Input is passed by the outside world to configure Formula instance. Similarly to State : Input is usually an immutable data class We use Input object in the evaluate(input, state) function to create Pair<UIModel, Actions> Any time there is an Input change, the Formula runtime will call evaluate again. This means that similarly to State , we can also use Input to define action conditions. if ( input . userId != null ) { val fetchUserStream = RxStream . fromObservable { repository . fetchUser ( input . userId ) } fetchUserStream . onEvent { userResult -> // Do something with the result } }","title":"Declarative API"},{"location":"Formula-Android/","text":"Formula Android The Android module provides a declarative API to connect reactive state management to Android Fragments. This module has been designed for gradual adoption. You can use as much or as little of it as you like. Some of the goals for this module are: - Use a single RxJava stream to drive the UI. - Separate state management from Android UI lifecycle. - Ability to group multiple fragments into a flow and share state between them. - Type-safe and scoped fragment event handling. (Avoid casting activity to a listener) Using Fragments This module provides an API to connect state management and view rendering logic to Android fragments. For this example, we will connect CounterRenderView and CounterFormula from the main getting started guide . Define a fragment key Fragment key is used to instantiate FormulaFragment and to identify which FeatureFactory to use. You can also use it to add arguments that the fragment instance needs. /** * Fragment key has to provide Parcelable implementation because it is passed * to the fragment as an argument. * * Read more about Parcelize: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/android-plugin.html */ @Parcelize data class CounterKey ( override val tag : String = \"counter\" ) : FragmentKey Define a feature factory A feature factory creates the state observable and a view factory for a fragment. To continue our example, we define a CounterFeatureFactory which will handle CounterKey fragments. class CounterFeatureFactory : FeatureFactory < Any , CounterKey > { override fun initialize ( dependencies : Any , key : CounterKey ): Feature <*> { val counterFormula = CounterFormula () return Feature ( state = counterFormula . toObservable (), viewFactory = CounterViewFactory () ) } } // View factory which uses XML layout resource. class CounterViewFactory : LayoutViewFactory < CounterRenderModel > ( R . layout . counter ) { override fun ViewInstance . create (): FeatureView < CounterRenderModel > { // We use [ViewInstance.view] to access the inflated view val counterView = CounterRenderView ( view ) // We create a [FeatureView] by passing a [RenderView] return featureView ( counterView ) } } We now need to register our feature factory with the activity in which the counter will be shown. class MyApp : Application () { override fun onCreate () { super . onCreate () FormulaAndroid . init ( this ) { activity ( MyActivity :: class ) { store { bind ( CounterFeatureFactory ()) } } } } } Use formula fragment The only thing left is navigating to this screen. We create FormulaFragment instance using our CounterKey and use fragment transactions to add it. class MyActivity : FormulaAppCompatActivity () { override fun onCreate ( savedInstanceState : Bundle?) { super . onCreate ( savedInstanceState ) setContentView ( R . layout . my_activity ) if ( savedInstanceState == null ) { val key = CounterKey () val fragment = FormulaFragment . newInstance ( key ) // Add the fragment using the fragment transaction API. supportFragmentManager . beginTransaction () . add ( R . id . activity_content , fragment , key . tag ) . commit () } } } If your Activity has another base class, you can just copy logic from FormulaAppCompatActivity into your Activity . And that's it Formula takes care of the rest. This is how the state observable works: When FormulaFragment is added, we instantiate and subscribe to the state observable. When FormulaFragment is removed, we destroy the state observable. The state management observable continues to run during configuration changes or if you navigate to another fragment. Passing arguments to a fragment Arguments can be passed using fragment key class. For example, we want to pass initial count value to the CounterFormula used in the previous examples. To accomplish that, let's update the CounterKey . @Parcelize data class CounterKey ( val initialCount : Int = 0 , override val tag : String = \"counter\" ) : FragmentKey You can access the CounterKey within CounterFeatureFactory class CounterFeatureFactory : FeatureFactory < Any , CounterKey > { override fun initialize ( dependencies : Any , key : CounterKey ): Feature <*> { val initialCount = key . initialCount val counterFormula = CounterFormula ( initialCount ) ... } } Fragment Event Handling Very frequently we need to pass events from a fragment to the parent/activity which trigger things like navigation. Let's say we want to add the following behaviors to the previous counter example: show a toast notification when user increments to 10 navigate to a new \"victory\" screen when user increments to 100. First, let's define a class that defines our events. data class CounterEventRouter ( val onToastNotification : ( String ) -> Unit , val onVictoryReached : () -> Unit ) We can now request this dependency within our feature factory class CounterFeatureFactory : FeatureFactory < Dependencies , CounterKey > { // We can ask for dependencies from the parent using an interface. interface Dependencies { fun counterEventRouter (): CounterEventRouter } override fun initialize ( dependencies : Dependencies , key : CounterKey ): Feature <*> { val counterEventRouter = dependencies . counterEventRouter () // We can pass the event router to the counter formula. val counterFormula = CounterFormula ( counterEventRouter ) return ... } } To provide dependencies, the parent component needs to extend CounterFeatureFactory.Dependencies class MyActivityComponent ( private val store : ActivityStoreContext < MyActivity > ) : CounterFeatureFactory . Dependencies { override fun counterEventRouter (): CounterEventRouter { return CounterEventRouter ( onToastNotification = this :: showToast , onVictoryReached = { // VictoryFragmentKey implementation is left to readers imagination. val key = VictoryFragmentKey () navigateTo ( key ) } ) } private fun showToast ( message : String ) { store . send { Toast . makeText ( this , message , Toast . LENGTH_LONG ). show () } } private fun navigateTo ( key : FragmentKey ) { store . send { // Sample fragment transaction val fragment = FormulaFragment . newInstance ( key ) supportFragmentManager . beginTransaction () . add ( R . id . activity_content , fragment , key . tag ) . addToBackStack ( null ) . commit () } } } To pass this component to feature factories, we need to update the configuration that lives within our Application . class MyApp : Application () { override fun onCreate () { super . onCreate () FormulaAndroid . init ( this ) { activity ( MyActivity :: class ) { store ( MyActivityComponent ( this )) { bind ( CounterFeatureFactory ()) } } } } } Handling back button events To override how the back button works for a particular navigation destination, your render model needs to implement BackCallback interface. data class FormRenderModel ( private val confirmBeforeExiting : Boolean , private val confirmUserWantsToExit : () -> Unit ): BackCallback { fun onBackPressed (): Boolean { // Check if we need to override back handling if ( confirmBeforeExiting ) { confirmUserWantsToExit () return true } // Use default behavior (which closes the screen) return false } } Your Activity needs to call FormulaAndroid.onBackPressed() . It will check if your current screen implements BackCallback and will invoke it. class MyActivity : FragmentActivity () { override fun onBackPressed () { if ( ! FormulaAndroid . onBackPressed ( this )) { super . onBackPressed () } } } This is already in place for you if you use FormulaAppCompatActivity . Fragment flow factory A flow factory groups multiple fragments and allows to share state, routers, action handlers and other dependencies between them. It has two generic parameters: Dependencies that the parent needs to provide. FlowComponent that will be shared with all features defined by this flow. For this example, let's say we are building authentication for our app. The backend provides view information such as the hints we should show for email or password fields. We want to only fetch this data once and share it between the login and sign up fragments. Let's say our repository class looks something like this class AuthRepo ( private val retrofit : Retrofit ) { // Backend provides data that helps us render auth pages. data class PageResponse ( val emailHint : String , val passwordHint : String , ) // This will check if we have in-memory response and // return that, otherwise make a fresh call. fun pageEvents (): Observable < AuthPageResponse > { ... } } As you can see above, this repository class needs a Retrofit instance to function. We can define the dependencies we need using an interface. interface Dependencies { fun retrofit (): Retrofit } Let's create our flow component. In a real application, component would usually be implemented by DI framework such as Dagger . class AuthFlowComponent ( private val dependencies : Dependencies ) { // Auth repo needs to be a singleton so we instantiate // this once when component is created. val authRepo = AuthRepo ( dependencies . retrofit ()) } We can now define AuthFlowFactory . A flow factory has two methods: createComponent - we create AuthFlowComponent here createFlow - we register feature factories that are part of our flow class AuthFlowFactory : FlowFactory < Dependencies , AuthFlowComponent > { interface Dependencies { fun retrofit (): Retrofit } class AuthFlowComponent ( private val dependencies : Dependencies ) { val authRepo = AuthRepo ( dependencies . retrofit ()) } override fun createComponent ( dependencies : Dependencies ): DisposableScope < AuthFlowComponent > { val flowComponent = AuthFlowComponent ( dependencies ) return DisposableScope ( flowComponent , onDispose = { // Here you can clear observables and dispose of other resources // that the component needed }) } override fun createFlow (): Flow < AuthFlowComponent > { return Flow . build { bind ( AuthRootFeatureFactory ()) bind ( LoginFeatureFactory ()) bind ( SignUpFeatureFactory ()) } } } Before we integrate AuthFlowFactory within our application, we need to update our app component to provide dependencies. class AppComponent () : AuthFlowFactory . Dependencies { override fun retrofit (): Retrofit { return ... } } Now that we have our dependencies configured, let's bind the flow factory to our activity store val appComponent = AppComponent () FormulaAndroid . init ( this ) { activity ( MyActivity :: class ) { store ( appComponent ) { bind ( AuthFlowFactory ()) } } } Formula calls createComponent when a formula fragment handled by createFlow is added. This component lives as long as there are any formula fragments defined by createFlow alive. The component is disposed once the last formula fragment is removed. Activity state management One of the goals of Formula is to make doing the right thing easy. As part of that we wanted to provide an easy way for state streams to survive configuration changes by default. Let's define a basic activity that has a renderTime method. class MyActivity : FormulaAppCompatActivity () { fun renderTime ( time : String ) { // implementation left to the reader } } To connect an RxJava Observable to renderTime , we define streams parameter which expects a Disposable back. Within this method you can subscribe to any number of RxJava streams. class MyApp : Application () { override fun onCreate () { super . onCreate () FormulaAndroid . init ( this ) { activity < MyActivity > { store ( streams = { // You can subscribe to your RxJava streams here. val timerState = Observable . interval ( 0 , 1 , TimeUnit . SECONDS ) . observeOn ( AndroidSchedulers . mainThread ()) . map { time -> \" $ time seconds\" } // update ensures that if configuration changes happen then // we send the last state to the new activity instance. update ( timerState , MyActivity :: renderTime ) } ) } } } } You might be confused about the update function called there. It is provided within the context of streams function using Kotlin receiver parameter StreamConfigurator . The update function ensures that state changes only arrive after Activity has started and that last state is applied if Activity is re-created due to configuration changes. It returns a Disposable . Managing dependencies Managing dependencies in Formula is very easy. In the function that instantiates the ActivityStore for your activity, you can create your activity specific dependencies or Dagger components. These objects will survive configuration changes. class MyApp : Application () { override fun onCreate () { super . onCreate () val appComponent : AppComponent = ... FormulaAndroid . init ( this ) { activity ( MyActivity :: class ) { // This component will survive configuration changes. val activityComponent = appComponent . createMyActivityComponent () store { } } } } } To inject the activity or create activity dependencies that don't survive configuration changes such as ones that need direct activity reference, you can use configureActivity callback. val appComponent : AppComponent = ... FormulaAndroid . init ( this ) { activity ( MyActivity :: class ) { // This component will survive configuration changes. val activityComponent = appComponent . createMyActivityComponent () store ( configureActivity = { // in this callback `this` is the instance of MyActivity // so we can use it to inject dependencies activityComponent . inject ( this ) // Or you can use setters to provide dependencies to your activity. // This dependency object won't survive configuration changes. val dependency = MyActivityDependency ( activity = this ) this . setDependency ( dependency ) } ) } }","title":"Formula Android"},{"location":"Formula-Android/#formula-android","text":"The Android module provides a declarative API to connect reactive state management to Android Fragments.

To show how Formula handles asynchronous events, we'll use a task app example. Let's say we have a task repository that exposes an RxJava Observable<List<Task>> . interface TaskRepo { fun tasks (): Observable < List < Task >> } All asynchronous events have to be declared within Formula.evaluate function. override fun Snapshot < Input , State > . evaluate (): Evaluation < Output > { return Evaluation ( output = createRenderModel ( state . taskList ), // All async events need to be declared within \"context.updates\" block. updates = context . updates { // Convert RxJava observable to a Formula Stream. val taskStream = RxStream . fromObservable ( taskRepo :: tasks ) // Tell Formula that you want to listen to these events events ( taskStream ) { newTaskList -> // update our state transition ( state . copy ( taskList = newTaskList )) } } ) } Formula uses a Stream interface to define an asynchronous event producers/sources. interface Stream < Event > { fun start ( send : ( Event ) -> Unit ): Cancelable? } In this example we used an RxStream.fromObservable to convert from an Observable to a Stream instance. Instead of us subscribing to the observable/stream directly, the runtime manages the subscriptions for us. It will subscribe the first time events is called and unsubscribe when our Formula is removed or if we don't return it anymore. For example, it is okay to have conditional logic. context . updates { if ( state . locationTrackingEnabled ) { val locationStream = RxStream . fromObservable { locationManager . updates () } events ( locationStream ) { event -> transition ( state . copy ( location = event . location )) } } } If state.locationTrackingEnabled changes from true to false , we won't return this Stream anymore and the runtime will unsubscribe. Fetching data Let's say we need to fetch a task that has a specific task id . interface TaskRepo { fun fetchTask ( taskId : String ): Observable < Task > } Using TaskRepo directly: class TaskFormula ( val taskRepo : TaskRepo ): Formula { data class Input ( val taskId : String ) data class State ( val task : Task? = null ) override fun Snapshot < Input , State > . evaluate (): Evaluation < Output > { return Evaluation ( updates = context . updates { val fetchTask = RxStream . fromObservable ( key = input . taskId ) { taskRepo . fetchTask ( input . taskId ) } events ( fetchTask ) { taskResponse -> transition ( state . copy ( task = taskResponse )) } } ) } } The key parameter enables us to distinguish between different streams. If input.taskId changes, we will cancel the currently running Stream and start a new one. Note: we are not handling errors in this example. The best practice is to emit errors as data using the onNext instead of emitting them through onError. Extending Stream Interface If you need to use a different mechanism for asynchronous events, you can extend Stream interface. interface Stream < Event > { fun start ( send : ( Event ) -> Unit ): Cancelable? } For example, let's say we want to track network status (I'm going to use mock network status APIs). class NetworkStatusStream ( val manager : NetworkStatusManager ) : Stream < NetworkStatus > { override fun start ( send : ( NetworkStatus ) -> Unit ): Cancelable? { val listener = object : NetworkStatusListener { override fun onNetworkStatusChanged ( status : NetworkStatus ) = send ( status ) } manager . addNetworkStatusListener ( listener ) return Cancelable { manager . removeNetworkStatusListener ( listener ) } } } We can now hook this up within our Formula: class MyFormula ( val networkStatus : NetworkStatusStream ): Formula < Input , State , Output > { override fun Snapshot < Input , State > . evaluate (): Evaluation < Output > { return Evaluation ( updates = context . updates { events ( networkStatus ) { status -> val updated = status . copy ( isOnline = status . isOnline ) transition ( updated ) } } ) } }","title":"Asynchronous Events"},{"location":"async_events/#fetching-data","text":"Let's say we need to fetch a task that has a specific task id . interface TaskRepo { fun fetchTask ( taskId : String ): Observable < Task > } Using TaskRepo directly: class TaskFormula ( val taskRepo : TaskRepo ): Formula { data class Input ( val taskId : String ) data class State ( val task : Task? = null ) override fun Snapshot < Input , State > . evaluate (): Evaluation < Output > { return Evaluation ( updates = context . updates { val fetchTask = RxStream . fromObservable ( key = input . taskId ) { taskRepo . fetchTask ( input . taskId ) } events ( fetchTask ) { taskResponse -> transition ( state . copy ( task = taskResponse )) } } ) } } The key parameter enables us to distinguish between different streams.

Let's go over it. To create a listener, we pass a function that returns a Transition<State> . Formula uses transitions to update internal state and/or perform side-effects to other components. Listeners are scoped to the current state. Any time we transition to a new state, evaluate is called again and the listeners are recreated. // Updating state context . onEvent { newName : String -> // We use kotlin data class copy function // to create a new state with new name transition ( state . copy ( name = newName )) } // Updating onSaveSelected to include validation context . onEvent { if ( state . name . isBlank ()) { // A transition which performs a side-effect. transition { input . showNotification ( \"Name cannot be empty!\" ) } } else { // No state change, performing side-effects as part of the transition transition { userService . updateName ( state . name ) analytics . trackNameUpdated ( state . name ) } } } To ensure safe execution, all side-effects should be performed within transition {} block which will be executed after the state change is performed. Sending messages to the parent To pass events to the parent, first define the listener on the Formula.Input class. data class ItemListInput ( val onItemSelected : Listener < ItemId > , ) Also, lets make sure that Input type is declared at the top of our formula . class ItemListFormula () : Formula < ItemListInput , ..., ... > Now, we can use the input passed to us in Formula.evaluate to communicate with the parent. override fun evaluate ( input : ItemListInput , state , context ): ... { return Evaluation ( output = state . items . map { item -> context . key ( item . id ) { ItemRow ( name = item . name , onClick = context . onEvent { // Notifying parent that item was selected. transition { input . onItemSelected ( item . id ) } } ) } } ) } Formula events There are a few events that every formula can listen to and respond.
