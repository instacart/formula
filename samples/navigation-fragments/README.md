# Navigation Fragments Formula Sample

This sample demonstrates infinite fragment navigation using the Formula framework for UI state management.

## Features

- **Infinite Routing**: Start with fragment 0 and navigate to infinitely many fragments (1, 2, 3, ...)
- **Local Counter State**: Each fragment manages its own counter state locally in its Formula
- **Global Event System**: A global store manages counter increment events via RxJava relay
- **Fragment Navigation**: Each fragment can navigate to the next fragment or back in the navigation stack
- **Counter Management**: Each fragment can increment its own counter or send increment events to other fragments
- **Formula Android Integration**: Demonstrates how Formula Android works with fragment navigation

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **NavigationFragmentKey**: Parcelable key that identifies fragments using integer IDs
2. **NavigationState**: Data class that holds the navigation stack (list of fragment IDs)
3. **NavigationStore**: RxJava-based store that manages:
   - Navigation state (current fragment, back stack)
   - Global counter increment events relay
4. **NavigationFragmentFormula**: Formula that manages individual fragment state including:
   - Local counter state
   - Navigation state subscription
   - Counter increment event subscription for this fragment
5. **NavigationFragmentFeatureFactory**: Creates Formula features for fragments
6. **NavigationFragmentViewFactory**: Creates Android views for fragments

### State Management Architecture

**Local State (per fragment):**

- Each fragment's counter is managed locally in its `NavigationFragmentFormula.State`
- Counter starts at 0 and increments when local button is pressed or global event is received

**Global State:**

- Navigation stack managed in `NavigationStore`
- Counter increment events transmitted via global `PublishRelay<Int>`
- Each fragment subscribes to counter increment events for its own fragment ID

### UI Elements

Each fragment contains:
- **Fragment Title**: Shows "Fragment X" where X is the fragment ID
- **Counter Display**: Shows the current counter value for this fragment (locally managed)
- **Increment Local Counter Button**: Increments this fragment's counter directly
- **Navigate to Next Fragment Button**: Creates and navigates to the next fragment (ID + 1)
- **Navigate Back Button**: Goes back in the navigation stack (hidden for the root fragment)
- **Back Stack Counter Buttons**: Buttons for each fragment in the back stack that send global increment events

### Navigation Flow

1. App starts with Fragment 0 (counter = 0)
2. User can tap "Increment Local Counter" to increment the current fragment's counter
3. User can tap "Navigate to Next Fragment" to create Fragment 1, 2, 3, etc.
4. User can tap "Navigate Back" to go back through the navigation stack
5. User can tap "Increment Counter for Fragment X" to send global events to other fragments
6. Each fragment receives increment events via global relay and updates its local counter

## Key Formula Android Concepts Demonstrated

- **Fragment Key Management**: Using `FragmentKey` to identify fragments
- **Local State Management**: Each fragment managing its own state via Formula
- **Global Event System**: Using RxJava relays for cross-fragment communication
- **Navigation Effects**: Using effects to communicate navigation actions from fragments to the activity
- **Fragment Lifecycle**: How Formula manages fragment creation, state updates, and navigation
- **Event Subscription**: How fragments subscribe to global events that affect their local state

## Usage

Run the app and:
1. Start on Fragment 0 with counter at 0
2. Tap "Increment Local Counter" to increment the current fragment's counter
3. Tap "Navigate to Next Fragment" to go to Fragment 1
4. Continue navigating to create more fragments
5. Use "Navigate Back" to return through the stack
6. Use "Increment Counter for Fragment X" buttons to send increment events to other fragments
7. Observe how each fragment's counter is managed locally but can be incremented from anywhere

This sample serves as preparation work for Jetpack Compose Navigation 3 support, demonstrating the core navigation and state management
patterns that will be adapted for the future "navigation-nav3" sample.
