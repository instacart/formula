## Formula Android
The Android module provides a declarative API to connect reactive state management to Android Fragments. 
This module has been designed for gradual adoption. You can use as much or as little of it as you like.

Some of the goals for this module are:

    - Use a single RxJava stream to drive the UI.
    - Separate state management from Android UI lifecycle.
    - Ability to group multiple fragments into a flow and share state between them.
    - Type-safe and scoped fragment event handling. (Avoid casting activity to a listener)

## Using Fragments
This module provides an API to connect state management and view rendering logic to Android 
fragments. For this example, we will connect `CounterRenderView` and `CounterFormula` from the 
main getting started [guide](index.md). 

### Define a fragment key
Fragment key is used to instantiate `FormulaFragment` and to identify which `FeatureFactory` to 
use. You can also use it to add arguments that the fragment instance needs. 

```kotlin
/**
 * Fragment key has to provide Parcelable implementation because it is passed 
 * to the fragment as an argument. 
 *   
 * Read more about Parcelize: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/android-plugin.html
 */
@Parcelize
data class CounterKey(
    override val tag: String = "counter"
) : FragmentKey
```

### Define a feature factory
A feature factory creates the state observable and a view factory for a fragment. To continue our 
example, we define a `CounterFeatureFactory` which will handle `CounterKey` fragments.

```kotlin
class CounterFeatureFactory : FeatureFactory<Any, CounterKey> {
    override fun initialize(dependencies: Any, key: CounterKey): Feature<*> {
        val counterFormula = CounterFormula()        
        return Feature(
            state = counterFormula.toObservable(),
            viewFactory = CounterViewFactory()
        )   
    }
}

// View factory which uses XML layout resource.
class CounterViewFactory : LayoutViewFactory<CounterRenderModel>(R.layout.counter) {
    override fun ViewInstance.create(): FeatureView<CounterRenderModel> {
        // We use [ViewInstance.view] to access the inflated view
        val counterView = CounterRenderView(view)

        // We create a [FeatureView] by passing a [RenderView]
        return featureView(counterView)
    }
}
```

We now need to register our feature factory with the activity in which the counter will be shown.
```kotlin
class MyApp : Application() {
    
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        
        FormulaAndroid.init(this) {
            activity(MyActivity::class) {
                store {
                    bind(CounterFeatureFactory())
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Use formula fragment
The only thing left is navigating to this screen. We create `FormulaFragment` instance using
our `CounterKey` and use fragment transactions to add it.
```kotlin
class MyActivity : FormulaAppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.my_activity)
        
        if (savedInstanceState == null) {
            val key = CounterKey()
            val fragment = FormulaFragment.newInstance(key)
            
            // Add the fragment using the fragment transaction API.
            supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
                .add(R.id.activity_content, fragment, key.tag)            
                .commit()    
        }
    }
}
```

If your `Activity` has another base class, you can just copy logic from `FormulaAppCompatActivity` into your `Activity`.

### And that's it
Formula takes care of the rest. This is how the state observable works:

- When `FormulaFragment` is added, we instantiate and subscribe to the state observable.
- When `FormulaFragment` is removed, we destroy the state observable.

The state management observable continues to run during configuration changes or if you navigate
to another fragment.

## Passing arguments to a fragment
Arguments can be passed using fragment key class. For example, we want to pass initial count 
value to the `CounterFormula` used in the previous examples. To accomplish that, let's update the
`CounterKey`.

```kotlin
@Parcelize
data class CounterKey(
    val initialCount: Int = 0,    
    override val tag: String = "counter"
) : FragmentKey
```

You can access the `CounterKey` within `CounterFeatureFactory`
```kotlin
class CounterFeatureFactory : FeatureFactory<Any, CounterKey> {
    override fun initialize(dependencies: Any, key: CounterKey): Feature<*> {
        val initialCount = key.initialCount    
        val counterFormula = CounterFormula(initialCount)        
        ...                
    }
}
```

## Fragment Event Handling
Very frequently we need to pass events from a fragment to the parent/activity which trigger 
things like navigation.
 
Let's say we want to add the following behaviors to the previous counter example:

- show a toast notification when user increments to 10 
- navigate to a new "victory" screen when user increments to 100. 

First, let's define a class that defines our events.
```kotlin
data class CounterEventRouter(
  val onToastNotification: (String) -> Unit, 
  val onVictoryReached: () -> Unit
)
```

We can now request this dependency within our feature factory 
```kotlin
class CounterFeatureFactory : FeatureFactory<Dependencies, CounterKey> {

    // We can ask for dependencies from the parent using an interface.
    interface Dependencies {
        fun counterEventRouter(): CounterEventRouter
    }

    override fun initialize(dependencies: Dependencies, key: CounterKey): Feature<*> {
        val counterEventRouter = dependencies.counterEventRouter()
        // We can pass the event router to the counter formula.
        val counterFormula = CounterFormula(counterEventRouter)        
        return ...
    }
}
```

To provide dependencies, the parent component needs to extend `CounterFeatureFactory.Dependencies`
```kotlin
class MyActivityComponent(
    private val store: ActivityStoreContext<MyActivity>
) : CounterFeatureFactory.Dependencies { 

    override fun counterEventRouter(): CounterEventRouter {
        return CounterEventRouter(
            onToastNotification = this::showToast,    
            onVictoryReached = {
                // VictoryFragmentKey implementation is left to readers imagination.
                val key = VictoryFragmentKey()
                navigateTo(key)
            }
        )
    }

    private fun showToast(message: String) {
        store.send {
            Toast.makeText(this, message, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
        }        
    }    

    private fun navigateTo(key: FragmentKey) {
       store.send {
           // Sample fragment transaction 
           val fragment = FormulaFragment.newInstance(key)
           supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
               .add(R.id.activity_content, fragment, key.tag)
               .addToBackStack(null)
               .commit()
       }  
    }    
}
```

To pass this component to feature factories, we need to update the configuration that lives 
within our `Application`.

```kotlin
class MyApp : Application() {
    
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        
        FormulaAndroid.init(this) {
            activity(MyActivity::class) {
                store(MyActivityComponent(this)) {
                    bind(CounterFeatureFactory())
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Handling back button events
To override how the back button works for a particular navigation destination, your render model needs to implement
`BackCallback` interface.

```kotlin
data class FormRenderModel(
    private val confirmBeforeExiting: Boolean,
    private val confirmUserWantsToExit: () -> Unit
): BackCallback {

    fun onBackPressed(): Boolean {
        // Check if we need to override back handling
        if (confirmBeforeExiting) {
            confirmUserWantsToExit()
            return true
        }
        
        // Use default behavior (which closes the screen)
        return false 
    }
}
```

Your `Activity` needs to call `FormulaAndroid.onBackPressed()`. It will check if your current screen
implements `BackCallback` and will invoke it.
```kotlin
class MyActivity : FragmentActivity() {

     override fun onBackPressed() {
         if (!FormulaAndroid.onBackPressed(this)) {
             super.onBackPressed()
         }
     }
}
```
This is already in place for you if you use `FormulaAppCompatActivity`.

## Fragment flow factory
A flow factory groups multiple fragments and allows to share state, routers, action handlers
and other dependencies between them. It has two generic parameters:

- `Dependencies` that the parent needs to provide. 
- `FlowComponent` that will be shared with all features defined by this flow.

For this example, let's say we are building authentication for our app. The backend provides view
information such as the hints we should show for email or password fields. We want to only fetch 
this data once and share it between the login and sign up fragments. Let's say our repository 
class looks something like this

```kotlin
class AuthRepo(private val retrofit: Retrofit) {

    // Backend provides data that helps us render auth pages.
    data class PageResponse(
        val emailHint: String,
        val passwordHint: String,
    )

    // This will check if we have in-memory response and
    // return that, otherwise make a fresh call.
    fun pageEvents(): Observable<AuthPageResponse> { ... }
}
```

As you can see above, this repository class needs a `Retrofit` instance to function. We can define
the dependencies we need using an interface.
```kotlin
interface Dependencies {
    fun retrofit(): Retrofit    
}
```

Let's create our flow component. In a real application, component would usually be implemented by DI framework such as `Dagger`.
```kotlin
class AuthFlowComponent(private val dependencies: Dependencies) {
    // Auth repo needs to be a singleton so we instantiate 
    // this once when component is created.
    val authRepo = AuthRepo(dependencies.retrofit())
}
```

We can now define `AuthFlowFactory`. A flow factory has two methods:

- `createComponent` - we create `AuthFlowComponent` here
- `createFlow` - we register feature factories that are part of our flow

```kotlin
class AuthFlowFactory : FlowFactory<Dependencies, AuthFlowComponent> {
    interface Dependencies {
        fun retrofit(): Retrofit    
    }
    
    class AuthFlowComponent(private val dependencies: Dependencies) {
        val authRepo = AuthRepo(dependencies.retrofit())
    }

    override fun createComponent(
        dependencies: Dependencies
    ): DisposableScope<AuthFlowComponent> {
        val flowComponent = AuthFlowComponent(dependencies)
        return DisposableScope(flowComponent, onDispose = {
            // Here you can clear observables and dispose of other resources 
            // that the component needed
        })
    }

    override fun createFlow(): Flow<AuthFlowComponent> {
        return Flow.build {
            bind(AuthRootFeatureFactory())
            bind(LoginFeatureFactory())
            bind(SignUpFeatureFactory())
        }
    }
}
```

Before we integrate `AuthFlowFactory` within our application, we need to update our app component
to provide dependencies.

```kotlin
class AppComponent() : AuthFlowFactory.Dependencies {
    override fun retrofit(): Retrofit {
        return ...
    }
}
```
 
 
Now that we have our dependencies configured, let's bind the flow factory to our activity store
```kotlin
val appComponent = AppComponent()
FormulaAndroid.init(this) {
    activity(MyActivity::class) {
        store(appComponent) {
            bind(AuthFlowFactory())
        }
    }
}
```

Formula calls `createComponent` when a formula fragment handled by `createFlow` is added. This 
component lives as long as there are any formula fragments defined by `createFlow` alive. The 
component is disposed once the last formula fragment is removed.     

## Activity state management
One of the goals of Formula is to make doing the right thing easy. As part of that we wanted to provide an easy
way for state streams to survive configuration changes by default. 

Let's define a basic activity that has a `renderTime` method.
```kotlin
class MyActivity : FormulaAppCompatActivity() {

    fun renderTime(time: String) {
        // implementation left to the reader
    }
}
```

To connect an RxJava Observable to `renderTime`, we define `streams` parameter which expects a `Disposable`
back. Within this method you can subscribe to any number of RxJava streams.    
```kotlin
class MyApp : Application() {
    
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        
        FormulaAndroid.init(this) {
            activity<MyActivity> {
            
                store(
                    streams = {
                        // You can subscribe to your RxJava streams here.
                        val timerState =  Observable
                            .interval(0, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                            .map { time ->
                                "$time seconds"
                            }
                            
                        // update ensures that if configuration changes happen then
                        // we send the last state to the new activity instance.    
                        update(timerState, MyActivity::renderTime)
                    }
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You might be confused about the `update` function called there. It is provided within the context of `streams` function
using Kotlin receiver parameter `StreamConfigurator`. The `update` function ensures that state changes only arrive after
`Activity` has started and that last state is applied if `Activity` is re-created due to configuration changes. It returns
a `Disposable`.


## Managing dependencies
Managing dependencies in Formula is very easy. In the function that instantiates the `ActivityStore` for your activity, 
you can create your activity specific dependencies or Dagger components. These objects will survive configuration changes.
```kotlin
class MyApp : Application() {
    
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        
        val appComponent: AppComponent = ...
        
        FormulaAndroid.init(this) {
            activity(MyActivity::class) {
                // This component will survive configuration changes.
                val activityComponent = appComponent.createMyActivityComponent()
                
                store { }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To inject the activity or create activity dependencies that don't survive configuration changes such as ones that need direct
activity reference, you can use `configureActivity` callback.
```kotlin
val appComponent: AppComponent = ...

FormulaAndroid.init(this) {
    activity(MyActivity::class) {
        // This component will survive configuration changes.
        val activityComponent = appComponent.createMyActivityComponent()
        
        store(
            configureActivity = {
                // in this callback `this` is the instance of MyActivity
                // so we can use it to inject dependencies
                activityComponent.inject(this)
                
                // Or you can use setters to provide dependencies to your activity.
                // This dependency object won't survive configuration changes.
                val dependency = MyActivityDependency(activity = this)
                this.setDependency(dependency)
            }
        )
    }
}
```
