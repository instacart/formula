### Only thread that created it can trigger transitions
The state management should be initialized on the main thread and all the transitions should also happen on the main thread. You 
will get the following exception if that is not the case.
```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Only thread that created it can trigger transitions. Expected: main, Was: Network 1
```

### Transition already happened.
After each transition, formula is re-evaluated and new event listeners are created. If you use an old listener
you will see the following exception.
```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Transition already happened. This is using old transition callback: $it.
```

### Callback is already defined.
TODO..
